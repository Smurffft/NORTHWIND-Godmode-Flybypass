# NORTHWIND-Godmode-Flybypass
NORTHWIND Godmode, Flybypass, Walkspeed Bypass

To use 'Flybypass' you will have to get Infinite Yeild
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source

After executing infinite yeild you must bind the command :Fly to any key you like
After Binding key, do not run fly, you must run "WalkingSpeedBypass" after executing 
You may press your key to fly bare in mind you can only fly for around 3 - 4 seconds before getting kicked
So keep stopping and starting, I will continue to fix the UI, and add more features

CHANGELOG
- fixed flybypass
- adding infinite stamina soon
- adding kill aura soon
- adding fast interaction soon
